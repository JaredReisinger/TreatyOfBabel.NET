#TreatyOfBabel.NET

A .NET implementation of the Treaty of Babel specification for text-adventure
games. See http://babel.ifarchive.org for more about the Treaty of Babel
itself.

##Other Tools

In addition to the ToB utility library (TreatyOfBabel.dll), there are two
EXEs used to verify the library: IffDump and GameLibrary.  IffDump is a
command-line tool that reports the structure of a game file.  GameLibrary
is a graphical front-end that shows the extracted information about each
game under a directory (recursively).
